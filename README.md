Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage - October 2024

### Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation - October 2024

As part of the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage, I undertook the role of a Data Analyst tasked with advising a hypothetical social media client. My responsibilities included:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Worked with seven datasets to clean and ensure the accuracy of the data, applying necessary transformations to make the datasets ready for analysis.
  
- **Data Modeling and Analysis:** Performed data modeling and analysis to uncover key insights into content trends, audience engagement, and platform performance. I identified critical metrics that could inform strategic decisions for the client's content strategies.
  
- **Deliverables:** I summarized my findings into a comprehensive PowerPoint deck, which was crafted to communicate insights clearly for both the client and internal Accenture stakeholders. Additionally, I created a video presentation to explain the analysis and recommendations in detail.

For this project, I successfully followed the outlined steps to analyze and model the data, using Excel for data cleaning, merging, and final analysis. Here's a breakdown of my process:

### Requirements Gathering:
I started by carefully reviewing the 7 datasets provided, along with the data model, to understand the relationships and ensure I was using the correct data to address the business questions.

### Data Cleaning:
I performed data cleaning to remove any inconsistencies and ensure that the data was accurate and ready for analysis. This involved checking for duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring uniform formatting across the datasets.

### Data Modelling:
For the data modeling process, I followed these steps:

1. **Merging the Data Sets:**
   I used the Reaction table as the base, and performed a series of joins:
   - First, I joined the relevant columns from the Content dataset.
   - Then, I linked the Reaction Types dataset using VLOOKUP to ensure the tables were merged properly and all relevant data was included.

2. **Calculating the Top 5 Performing Categories:**
   Using the SUMIF formula, I calculated the total scores for each category. From there, I identified the top 5 performing categories based on their scores.

### Final Deliverable:
I compiled all the information into a single cleaned dataset and ensured it contained the top 5 categories as required. The final data file was uploaded for review as per the task instructions.
