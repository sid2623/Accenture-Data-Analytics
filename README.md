### Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation - October 2024

As part of the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage, I undertook the role of a Data Analyst tasked with advising a hypothetical social media client. My responsibilities included:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Worked with seven datasets to clean and ensure the accuracy of the data, applying necessary transformations to make the datasets ready for analysis.
  
- **Data Modeling and Analysis:** Performed data modeling and analysis to uncover key insights into content trends, audience engagement, and platform performance. I identified critical metrics that could inform strategic decisions for the client's content strategies.
  
- **Deliverables:** I summarized my findings into a comprehensive PowerPoint deck, which was crafted to communicate insights clearly for both the client and internal Accenture stakeholders. Additionally, I created a video presentation to explain the analysis and recommendations in detail.

This simulation helped me further develop my skills in data analysis, visualization, and communicating insights effectively to decision-makers.
